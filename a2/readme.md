In my version of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life:
(1) A pattern could be drawn on the grid only if there is enough sapce for the pattern.
For example, if you select Block as you pattern and you want to draw the block on the most top right 
cell, the Block will not appear on th grid since there are only 2 cells left but a Block needs 4 cells.
(2) A pattern could be drawn on the top of others. (Overlapping is allowed)

*Note: If user is in the manual mode, when users draw a shape after pause, the shape will appear on the
grid immediately and the frame number will also update at the same time. 


Hotkey Settings:

Pause: Pause the animation and swtich to manual mode.
Pause	<- P Button

Next: Advance one frame at a time only when manual mode is on.
Next 	<- N Button 

Resume: Resume the animation when manual mode is on.
Resume	<- R Button
