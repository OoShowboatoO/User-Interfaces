In my version of Lightbox:

Only jpg, png and bmp files will be treated as image file that could dispaly in the lightbox.

Default window size: 1000 * 800
Maximume window size: 1600 * 1200
Minimum window size: 950 * 600

Cascade Mode:
If the window is resized in a way that would obscure an image, the image will be repositioned to a 
location that is close to the boundraies.

Tile Mode:
All transformation buttons will be disabled.
Resizing in Tile mode should cause the images to reflow to fit the window size (e.g. if the user 
resizes the window smaller, the images should rearrange into fewer columns; if they make the window 
larger, the number of columns might increase).
